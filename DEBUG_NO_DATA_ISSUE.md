# Debug: "No Data Available" Issue Analysis

## Problem
- APIs are returning 200 OK with data
- Frontend shows "No Data Available" message
- Super admin should see system data but doesn't

## Debug Steps Added

### 1. **Enhanced API Response Logging**
Added detailed logging in:
- `lib/api/client.ts` - logs raw API responses
- `lib/stores/predictions-store.ts` - logs data parsing results

### 2. **Data Filtering Debug**
Added comprehensive logging in:
- `getFilteredPredictions()` - shows what data is available and how it's filtered
- Data flow from API → parsing → filtering → display

### 3. **User Role Debug**
Enhanced logging in:
- `data-access-filter.tsx` - shows user role detection
- `predictions-store.ts` - shows default filter selection

### 4. **Disabled Caching Temporarily**
- Bypassed 5-minute cache to force fresh data fetch
- Ensures data is always fetched on page load

## What to Check in Browser Console

### Expected Flow:
1. **Auth Check**: User role and permissions
2. **API Calls**: 4 parallel API calls (annual, quarterly, system annual, system quarterly)
3. **Data Parsing**: Raw responses converted to prediction objects
4. **Default Filter**: Based on user role (`super_admin` → `system`)
5. **Data Filtering**: System predictions filtered for super admin
6. **Rendering**: Data displayed in dashboard

### Look for These Console Messages:
```
🎯 DataSourceTabs - Setting data filter for user: {...}
🌐 API Response for /predictions/annual: {...}
📊 API Response Debug: {...}
📊 Data processing results: {...}
🎯 INITIAL FILTER DECISION: {...}
🔍 FILTERING annual predictions: {...}
🚨 DASHBOARD RENDER CHECK: {...}
```

## Most Likely Causes

### 1. **API Response Structure Mismatch**
- Backend might return data in different format than expected
- Check if data is wrapped in `items`, `predictions`, or direct array

### 2. **User Role Detection Issue**
- Super admin role not being detected correctly
- Check if `user.role` is exactly `"super_admin"`

### 3. **Data Filtering Logic Error**
- System data not being properly separated from user data
- Check if `organization_access` field is set correctly

### 4. **Empty Response Data**
- APIs returning 200 but with empty data arrays
- Check if backend has actual prediction data

## Quick Fixes to Try

### 1. **Check User Role**
In browser console:
```javascript
// Check current user
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('auth-store') || '{}'))
```

### 2. **Force System Filter**
Temporarily hardcode system filter to test data availability.

### 3. **Check API Response Format**
Look at the detailed API logs to see actual data structure.

## Next Steps
1. Login as super admin
2. Open browser developer tools
3. Check console logs for the debug messages above
4. Share the console output to identify the exact issue
