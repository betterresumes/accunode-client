# Super Admin Data Source Restriction - Implementation

## Changes Made

### ðŸ”§ **Removed Personal and Organization Tabs for Super Admin**

**In `components/dashboard/data-access-filter.tsx`:**
- Modified the super admin section to only show "Platform" tab
- Removed "Personal" and "Organizations" tabs from super admin view
- Super admins now see only one tab: "Platform" (system data)

**Before:**
```tsx
// Super admin had: Personal | Organizations | Platform
<TabsTrigger value="personal">Personal</TabsTrigger>
<TabsTrigger value="organization">Organizations</TabsTrigger>
<TabsTrigger value="system">Platform</TabsTrigger>
```

**After:**
```tsx
// Super admin now has: Platform only
<TabsTrigger value="system">Platform</TabsTrigger>
```

### ðŸ”§ **Enhanced Data Filter Restrictions**

**In `lib/stores/predictions-store.ts`:**
- Added role-based restrictions in `setDataFilter` function
- Super admin attempts to access non-system data are automatically redirected to system
- Added security enforcement to prevent bypassing the UI restrictions

```tsx
setDataFilter: (filter: string) => {
  // Super admin can only access 'system' data
  if (user?.role === 'super_admin' && filter !== 'system') {
    console.log(`ðŸš« Super admin attempted to access "${filter}" data - restricting to "system" only`)
    filter = 'system'
  }
  // ... rest of logic
}
```

### ðŸ”§ **Updated Default Filter Logic**

- Enhanced the comment for super admin default filter to clarify it's the ONLY allowed access
- Super admins will always default to 'system' and cannot access other data sources

## Result

### âœ… **Super Admin Experience:**
- **Only sees "Platform" tab** in the data source selector
- **Cannot access personal or organization data** through the UI
- **Backend security** prevents bypassing UI restrictions
- **Automatically redirected** to system data if they somehow attempt to access other sources

### âœ… **Other User Roles Unchanged:**
- **Regular users**: Still have "Your Data" and "Platform" tabs
- **Tenant admins**: Still have "Organizations" and "Platform" tabs  
- **Org admins/members**: Still have "Your Org" and "Platform" tabs

### âœ… **Security:**
- **UI restrictions** prevent super admins from selecting personal/org data
- **Store-level enforcement** blocks any attempts to bypass UI
- **Automatic fallback** to system data for any invalid filter attempts
- **Clear logging** for debugging and audit purposes

## Files Modified

1. `components/dashboard/data-access-filter.tsx` - Removed personal/org tabs for super admin
2. `lib/stores/predictions-store.ts` - Added role-based filter restrictions and enhanced comments

## Debug Information

Super admins attempting to access restricted data will see this console log:
```
ðŸš« Super admin attempted to access "personal" data - restricting to "system" only
```

This ensures super admins can only view platform-wide data and cannot access individual user or organization-specific data.
