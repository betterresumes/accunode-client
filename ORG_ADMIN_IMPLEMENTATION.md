## Role-Based Access Control

### Super Admin

- Full access to all features

### Tenant Admin  
- Organization management tab
- Can create and manage organizations within their tenant

### Organization Admin
- "My Organization" tab with complete org management
- Can invite users, manage whitelist, regenerate tokens
- View and manage organization members
- Access to organization statistics and settings

### Regular Users (org_member, user)
- "Join Organization" tab
- Can join organizations using email and join token
- Limited to joining organizations where their email is whitelisted

## Technical Implementation

### Components Structure
```
components/admin/
├── org-admin-management.tsx     # Complete org admin dashboard
├── join-organization.tsx        # User join organization form  
├── invite-user-dialog.tsx       # Invite users dialog (reused)
└── organization-management-tab.tsx # Updated with invite functionality
```

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /organizations/{id}` - Get organization details
- `GET /organizations/{id}/users` - Get organization members
- `GET /organizations/{id}/whitelist` - Get whitelist emails
- `POST /organizations/{id}/whitelist` - Add email to whitelist
- `DELETE /organizations/{id}/whitelist/{email}` - Remove email from whitelist
- `POST /organizations/{id}/regenerate-token` - Regenerate join token
- `POST /organizations/join` - Join organization with email and token

### State Management
- Uses Zustand auth store for user state management
- Automatic profile refresh after organization join
- Real-time data updates with loading states
- Error handling with toast notifications

## Usage Instructions

### For Organization Admins
1. Navigate to Settings → My Organization
2. View organization overview and statistics
3. Manage members in the Members section
4. Add emails to whitelist for invitations
5. Generate/copy join tokens for users
6. Use invite functionality to send invitations

### For Regular Users
1. Navigate to Settings → Join Organization
2. Enter your email (pre-filled)
3. Enter the join token provided by org admin
4. Click "Join Organization"
5. Success message and automatic profile refresh

### For API Integration
The join organization endpoint expects:
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "join_token": "organization-join-token"
}
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "organization_name": "Organization Name",
  "message": "Successfully joined organization"
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Email Whitelist Validation
- Only whitelisted emails can join organizations
- Server-side validation of email against whitelist
- Join token must be valid and not expired

### Role-Based Access
- UI components respect user roles and permissions
- API endpoints validate user permissions server-side
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access

### Token Security
- Join tokens can be regenerated by org admins
- Tokens are only visible when explicitly requested
- Copy functionality for secure token sharing

## Testing

### Organization Admin Features
1. Test organization overview loading
2. Test member list and pagination
3. Test whitelist management (add/remove emails)
4. Test join token regeneration and copying
5. Test invite user functionality

### Join Organization Features
1. Test form validation (email format, required fields)
2. Test successful organization join
3. Test error handling (invalid token, not whitelisted)
4. Test profile refresh after joining
5. Test toast notifications

### Role-Based Access
1. Test tab visibility for different user roles
2. Test component rendering based on permissions
3. Test API access control

This implementation provides a complete organization management system with proper role-based access control and user-friendly interfaces for both administrators and regular users.
